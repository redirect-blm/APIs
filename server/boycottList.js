Corporate PACs are controlled by the employees of the company, not the company itself or its leadership. At some companies, corporate PACs function as a way for employees to donate in alignment w/ company leaders. The CEO of CVS, though, has given to both Republican and Democrat candidates and causes including an Obama victory fund in 2011. He's never donated to Trump. The CVS corporate PAC donates fairly evenly across the aisle in general. In the 2018 midterms it gave slightly more to Democratic candidates. The CVS story was more about one of its vendors, The Pill Club, being in a contract dispute with CVS. Pill Club is a subscription birth control service that delivers birth control and other prescriptions by mail. It appears to have used that one particular CVS PAC donation to gain leverage in its contract dispute with CVS. It speaks to the toxicity of the Trump administration that even an employee PAC that gives fairly evenly across the aisle can be implicated and Grab Your Wallet Alliance does recommend employee PACs avoid donating to pro-Trump PACs due to the risks it poses to the company's brand, however this one, in our opinion, does not rise to the level of a boycott-able concern.

      reason:
        '"The $240 million-a-year Southwest Key organization has big contracts with the government to house immigrant minors in its two dozen low-security shelters in Texas, Arizona, and California, a population that in recent weeks has exploded with infants and children removed from their parents." CNN reported in June 2018 that Southest Key CEO Juan Sanchez makes $1.47 million a year, a salary that "reflects the organization\'s growth." That\'s deeply problematic even for a nonprofit b/c it creates an incentive for guys like Sanchez to financially back extremists like Donald Trump in future elections. (For perspective, the head of the American Red Cross is paid $600k per year.)',

Copies of the live-streamed video were reposted on many platforms including Twitter and YouTube. People are encouraged to reach out to the three companies that did this to ask that they implement stricter policies to prevent this sort of content from being livestreamed again. Examples of things consumers are asking for: (1) a concerted effort to crack down on white nationalists' use of social media similar to the successful crackdown on ISIS (2) better pay, treatment, and employement status for content moderators to ensure higher quality of work (3) limitations and/or delays on livestreaming capabilities for new, suspicious, and/or potentially politically extreme users (4) greater investment of resources in implementing technology & tactics that will prevent such content from being mass disseminated.\")",
